Things to keep in mind:
- These lines are not organised at all and they're completely raw.
- I only recorded a couple of ad libs due to external complications, sorry!
- This is practically my first time doing JP Voice Acting.

Thank you for bearing with me nonetheless, and if you need me to re-record anything, let me know!
